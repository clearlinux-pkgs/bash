This is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn
shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX
P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional improvements
over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts
can be run by Bash without modification.
